		  <h2>South Korean labor minister: Koreans must learn how to work with machines</h2>
	  </div>
		<p>South Korea's Employment Minister said many jobs in the future will be handled by AI and robot Koreans. If South Koreans want to survive and develop, they must learn how to work with machines.<br>
		  &quot;Automation and artificial intelligence will change South Korea more quickly,&quot; South Korea's Employment Minister said on Tuesday &quot;Not all jobs can be replaced by machines, but it is very important to learn how to use machines better through training.&quot;<br>
		  While people have to improve how to adapt to the rapidly changing high-tech environment, policy makers also need to play a role. He added that the government needs to provide support so that workers can move from one sector of the economy to another to find jobs and find ways to increase South Korean women's participation in the economy.<br>
		  The South Korean government is determined to promote the growth strategy with science and technology as the core. Taking advantage of the professional skills of global technology giants such as Samsung Electronics, South Korea is speeding up its transformation into a technology centered elastic economy, which can continue to play an excess role in the global key supply chain through innovation, and ensure that even in the event of another epidemic or similar crisis, South Korea's economy can run at full speed.<br>
		  &quot;With the progress of technology, new jobs will be created.&quot; &quot;In terms of policy, it is important to support workers to move from declining industries to emerging industries.&quot;<br>
		  To promote this change, the South Korean government plans to expand its employment insurance program to 21 million people by 2025, accounting for more than 40% of the total population. The project is part of the government's plan to provide financial support in the form of insurance for all workers in South Korea, including artists, freelancers and participants in the casual economy.<br>
		  In addition, the South Korean government will provide subsidies to young people to encourage them to continue looking for jobs. It is difficult for them to keep their jobs in the context of slowing economic growth, and the epidemic makes it more difficult for young people in South Korea to find jobs.<br>
		  South Korea has failed to contain the sharp rise in unemployment.<br>
	    The hardest hit group is women in the service industry who need face-to-face communication. The low proportion of women in the labor force is one of the biggest labor problems in South Korea.</p>
