      The official version of Microsoft Windows terminal 1.7 was released yesterday. According to the official release habit, when the official version of 1.7 is released, the preview version of 1.8 will arrive at the same time.<br>
      The preview version of Windows terminal 1.8 is mainly based on 1.7 with minor changes to optimize the user experience of setting UI.<br>
      Set UI to configure default opening mode:<br>
      Users can access the settings UI by clicking the settings button in the drop-down menu or entering &quot;Ctrl + comma&quot;. At present, the experience of setting up UI is still improving.<br>
      Shift + Click: opens a profile in a new window<br>
      Now the user can hold down the shift key and click the profile in the drop-down menu to open the profile in a new window.<br>
      Lost focus style:<br>
      Users can add an &quot;unfocused appearance&quot; object to the JSON object in their configuration file and specify the appearance settings in it. These appearance settings are enabled when the window loses focus.<br>
      Window namingï¼š<br>
      New terminal window naming function. Click here to view the specific usage.<br>
      Set UI update:<br>
      Font face dropdown: users can use the drop-down menu instead of entering the font name to select the font style. This drop-down menu also has filters for monospace fonts and non monospace fonts.<br>
      Delete base layer: due to some architecture conflicts with JSON fragment extension, the development team decided to remove the base layer page from the setup UI. It is currently planning other ways to use the setup UI to edit all configuration files at once. Users can still use it settings.json  The &quot;defaults&quot; section in the file is used as a temporary method.</td>
