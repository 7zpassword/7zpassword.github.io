		<p>Google Chrome Remote Code Execution Vulnerability, Comprehensive Rating 'High Risk'</p>
		<p>I. Analysis of vulnerability<br>
		  Googlechrome is a web browser developed by Google, which is based on WebKit, Mozilla and other open source software development, the goal is to improve stability, speed and security, and create a simple, effective user interface.</p>
		<p>On April 14, 2021, the National Vulnerability Sharing Platform for Information Security (CNVD) included the Googlechrome Remote Code Execution Vulnerability. Unauthenticated attackers can use this vulnerability to achieve remote code execution attacks on browsers by carefully constructing malicious pages and inviting victims to visit them. However, attackers cannot achieve SandBox escape by using this vulnerability alone. Sandboxes are the security boundaries of the GoogleChrome browser that prevent malicious code from damaging a user's system or other pages in the browser. GoogleChrome turns on sandbox protection by default.</p>
		<p>CNVD gave the vulnerability a combined rating of &quot;high risk&quot;.</p>
		<p>II. Scope of vulnerability influence<br>
		  The product versions affected by the vulnerability include:</p>
		<p>GoogleChrome &lt; = 89.0.4389.114.</p>
		<p>III. Suggestions on vulnerability disposal<br>
		  While Google has yet to release a new version or patch to fix the bug, CNVD advises users to leave the default sandbox mode on when using GoogleChrome, and to be cautious about accessing links or files from unknown sources.</p>
