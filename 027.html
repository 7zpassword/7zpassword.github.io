	  <p>Gemini, a large cryptocurrency exchange platform in the US, now allows users to buy cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin through Apple Pay and Google Pay.<br>
	    Gemini users can now buy passwords on the platform with their Apple Pay or Google Pay. Users can withdraw money within an hour of making a purchase, the company noted.<br>
	    The feature supports more than 30 cryptocurrencies, with a Gemini spokesperson pointing out that &quot;all tokens except DAI can be purchased through Apple Pay and Google Pay.&quot;<br>
	    The consolidation of the cryptocurrency industry with traditional financial payment services has been expanding in recent months. In February, crypto payment provider BitPay announced a major integration plan with Apple Pay, allowing its users to connect to Apple Wallet and use cryptocurrencies to Pay for goods and services such as BTC, ETH and LTC.<br>
      In March, crypto payments company Simplex also allowed Apple Pay users to buy the coTi cryptocurrency.</p>
