		  <h2>Boston power robot dog spot: pour beer, but act like pee</h2>
	  </div>
		<p>Less than a year after the Boston power robot dog spot was sold to the public, a humorous and intelligent YouTube guy successfully trained spot &quot;rhubarb dog&quot; to pour beer into a glass, but it was too much like peeing. So far, the video of spot peeing beer in the cup has been viewed more than 6 million times on YouTube.<br>
		  &quot;It's a masterpiece of engineering,&quot; Michael Reeves explained in the video! I'm going to make it pee beer in the glass. &quot;<br>
		  In the video, rivers reprogrammes the big yellow dog of Boston Dynamics to accomplish some interesting tasks. After several failed attempts, such as spilling beer all over the floor, rivers finally managed to get his rhubarb dog to pour beer into a mug accurately.<br>
		  But spot is not cheap. Regular buyers can order through Boston Dynamics. A big yellow dog costs $74500<br>
		  Through programming training, spot can also perform other unique tasks. For example, the whole process of dancing looks as smooth as CGI; spot is also used in hospitals to prevent the spread of the epidemic; and even joined the New York Police Department to become a machine &quot;police dog&quot;<br>
		  SpaceX also bought a spot. A while ago, some netizens saw spot patrolling at the scene of Sn10 explosion.<br>
	    Of course, like a woman in Florida, you can buy a spot and walk your dog on the beach without doing anything.</p>
