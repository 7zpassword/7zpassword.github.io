      SpaceX's new satellite chain Satellite Internet service is currently in a very limited testing phase. But the company is now considering applying to the FCC for star chain applications to enable the service to be used in vehicles in motion.<br>
      Musk: Star chain service will be &quot;fully mobile&quot; by the end of this year<br>
      In a new tweet, mask said the existing star chain terminals were too big for Tesla, the idea for airplanes, RV, trucks and ships.<br>
      For star chain services, this application will bring about great changes.<br>
      Currently, star chain does not even allow users to move existing hardware from one address to another - if you can enter the beta, the registry clearly shows that the service is limited to the location filled in when registering. This is mainly because the star chain service has not been completed completely.<br>
      Of course, it is not a permanent limit. Elon clarified this again today on Twitter:<br>
      &quot;Yes, it will be completely moved later this year, so you can move it anywhere, or you can use it in a RV or truck. We need more satellite launches and some key software upgrades to achieve wider coverage. &quot;<br>
      &quot;The current star chain service commitment is more attractive than broadband for us operators, but early testers report mixed results and will continue to improve,&quot; Mr. mask said in a tweet.</td>
