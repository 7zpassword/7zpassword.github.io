		  <h2>Huawei's new method enables developers to easily convert GMS applications into HMS applications, doubling the speed</h2>
	  </div>
		<p>We know that Huawei's new phones are unable to use Google mobile services (GMS), forcing it to take out its own mobile services (HMS) suite as an alternative. However, the applications integrated with GMS (i.e. using Google services for notification, map, location, etc.) will either not work properly or not work at all on these new Huawei devices.<br>
		  Huawei's new approach allows developers to easily convert GMS applications to HMS applications, twice as fast as possible<br>
		  Now Huawei has announced an open source solution called choice SDK. This solution can basically turn the existing GMS application into HMS application, saving time and resources for application developers. According to the GitHub page of SDK, the solution currently supports location, check-in, analysis, map and message functions.<br>
		  Huawei developed the choice SDK to help a bank in Austria provide services to Huawei device users. But bluesource, the developer, added that Austria's national television broadcasting company, railway services, postal services and a local transaction app all used the solution, bringing their app to Huawei's appgallery.<br>
	    This is a very interesting and ingenious way to solve the problem of GMS application running on Huawei equipment. In theory, it should reduce the development work of the studio. However, it does not seem to be a one click process, so there is still a certain degree of work for developers to do. But Huawei said developers can use the tool to provide HMS support at twice the speed compared to the standard method for enabling HMS in applications.</p>
