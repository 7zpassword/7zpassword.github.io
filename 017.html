	  <p>The State Key Laboratory of electronic thin film and integrated devices (University of Electronic Science and Technology) officially released the world's first CMOS monolithic all silicon micro display chip.<br>
	    Relying on the collaborative innovation center of core electronic materials and devices jointly built by &quot;cetc-ust&quot;, the silicon light R &amp;amp; D team of the laboratory has carried out school enterprise cooperation, and successfully developed the world's first all silicon micro display chip sample based on silicon self luminescence.<br>
	    It is reported that the &quot;original idea&quot; of this work is to creatively completely avoid the natural defects of silicon material (indirect band gap) band structure, use the reverse bias of PN junction to obtain a kind of &quot;bremsstrahlung&quot; luminescence, and then introduce the same as the standard silicon IC (SI) - CMOS technology fully compatible with the MOS structure, greatly enhance the luminous intensity. This &quot;original concept&quot; was published in the English version of compound semiconductor in May 2019.<br>
	    The R &amp;amp; D team is committed to all silicon optoelectronic integration and continues to carry forward this &quot;original concept&quot;. It not only pursues &quot;being able to emit light&quot;, but also emphasizes &quot;being able to use&quot;.<br>
	    It is understood that they have recently successfully realized the &quot;all silicon micro display&quot; array with the LED as the pixel unit; The birth of this new microled display chip subverts the traditional thinking and is expected to replace LCD and OLED in the established field.<br>
	    Through the design of array back-end driver circuit and the realization of single chip integration of the circuit and light-emitting array, in 10 × Large scale pixel cell matrization (100) is completed on a chip area of 10mm2 × The design of modulation port greatly enhances the luminous flux per unit area and the overall luminous uniformity of pixel array, and the luminous intensity increases by more than 139 . 2%, the driving voltage is reduced by more than 67%, and the goal of &quot;more light and less heat&quot; is achieved successfully.<br>
      In order to meet the urgent demand of low power consumption and high frame rate for micro display, a semi-active addressing driving circuit is designed. The frame rate of image display is more than or equal to 100fps, and the negative impact of crosstalk between pixels is effectively reduced; In order to solve the problem that ordinary packaging can not provide enough interfaces to lead out control lines, a variable and controllable digital interface module is specially designed and embedded in the chip integration. Only three signal lines are needed to ensure the high-speed transmission of data from the host to the chip. Without additional process adjustment and post-processing for the driver circuit and interface circuit module, it can match with the pixel array in the center of the chip, reducing the cost of chip design and manufacturing, reflecting the pioneering idea of developing low-cost and high-quality micro display technology with all silicon materials.</p>
