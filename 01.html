		<p>Huawei global analysts conference was held on April 12. Xu Zhijun, vice chairman and rotating chairman of Huawei, explained Huawei's overall strategy with the theme of "flying through the clouds is still calm". Huawei's performance in 2020 is in line with expectations, he said. Mobile phone business declined last year, but further improved the layout of notebook, tablet and other hardware areas, so the company's overall revenue kept growing. Facing sustainable development in the future, Huawei has further increased R &amp; D investment, which accounted for 15.9% of sales revenue last year. 2021 is a challenging year for Huawei and the beginning of its future development strategy.<br>
