	  <p>Apple's M1 iPad Pro preview today supports the center stage feature in video calls and other scenarios. According to the latest news, third party app will also support this feature.<br>
	    At the conference, apple did not indicate whether the center feature only supports Apple's own face time call. Federico vitic, the IOS developer, said third-party applications would be able to use the feature through the API framework, which means it is expected to be enabled in video calls between teams and zoom.<br>
      The new ultra wide angle front camera, with 12 megapixel sensor and 122 degree view, is also equipped with ipadpro, which brings new character center function, which is very suitable for face time video calls. According to the official, it's also good to take selfie in portrait mode, which can definitely make you have style and style. With the original deep camera, the ipadpro can also be unlocked safely through the face ID.</p>
