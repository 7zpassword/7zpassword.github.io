      Nvidia has gradually discontinued the GA106-300-A1 GPU core originally used by RTX 3060 and transferred it to the production of GA106-302-A1, which is scheduled for delivery in May.<br>
      The restriction on mining is the bottom level, because the PCI ID cannot be corresponding, resulting in cracking mining development version of the driver instantaneous failure.<br>
      Nvidia, it seems, has changed more than ever.<br>
      New cores GA104-202, GA104-302, GA102-202 and GA102-302 have been introduced and are expected to correspond to new versions of RTX 3060 TI, RTX 3070, RTX 3080 and RTX 3090, respectively.<br>
      This also means that the future market is likely to put on the new Amperes graphics card, have done the bottom mining restrictions.</td>
