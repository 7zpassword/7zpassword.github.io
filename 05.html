		  <h2>Vivo will effectively protect the privacy and security of users through two authoritative authentication</h2>
	  </div>
		<p>Recently, vivo has officially passed the two authoritative authentication of trust and eprivacyseal, which marks the privacy protection ability of vivo to a new level and reaches the first-class level in the world.<br>
		  It is understood that the trust enterprise privacy certification framework standards are based on recognized legal and regulatory standards, such as OECD privacy standards, APEC privacy frameworks, EU general data protection regulations (&quot;gdpr&quot;), the U.S. health insurance portability and Liability Act (&quot;HIPAA&quot;), ISO 27001 international standards for information security management systems and other global privacy laws and regulations. Vivo has obtained the certification, which means it meets the international standards of privacy protection, and the relevant technology and management ability are recognized by trustarc, the authority of American privacy certification.<br>
		  Another eprivacyseal certification, issued by eprivacy, an European privacy certification authority, provides transparent certification processes and reliable certification standards, which has authority and wide influence in the EU and the world. The certification covers the requirements of gdpr for digital products. The objects of certification are evaluated from the legal and technical dimensions to ensure that the legal requirements of gdpr are covered. GPDR was once known as the &quot;most stringent data protection legislation in history&quot;, and the I Butler and vivo album of vivo have passed this authority certification. In terms of privacy security, they also have the certification escort of international authority.<br>
	    In addition, vivo has obtained many authoritative certification in privacy security protection, such as iso/iec27001 information security certification and iso/iec27701 privacy information management system certification.</p>
